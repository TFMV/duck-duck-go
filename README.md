# DuckDB Go Bindings Example

ðŸš§ Warning: The DuckDB Go bindings are in early development. ðŸš§

Expect potential API changes and missing functionality.

This project demonstrates how to use the DuckDB Go bindings to interact with DuckDB databases from Go applications.
It provides a simple interactive CLI showcasing:

- Creating an in-memory DuckDB database
- Executing SQL queries
- Using prepared statements
- Retrieving query results
- Appending data to tables
- Exporting data to CSV files

## Overview

DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP database management system designed for analytical queries. This example application demonstrates how to:

- Create an in-memory DuckDB database
- Execute SQL statements
- Use prepared statements with parameters
- Fetch and display query results
- Append data to tables
- Export data to CSV files

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or higher
- macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) for this specific example

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/duck-duck-go.git
   cd duck-duck-go
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The application presents a menu with the following options:

1. Basic Example - Demonstrates in-memory database with simple queries
2. Quit - Exit the application

## Implementation Details

The application uses the platform-specific DuckDB Go bindings for macOS ARM64:

```go
import (
    bindings "github.com/duckdb/duckdb-go-bindings/darwin-arm64"
)
```

Key components:

- Database Creation â†’ Creates an in-memory DuckDB instance
- Query Execution â†’ Executes SQL queries directly
- Prepared Statements â†’ Uses parameterized SQL for safe queries
- Result Processing â†’ Retrieves query results
- Data Export â†’ Saves tables as CSV

## Limitations

ðŸš¨ This is an early-stage implementation with limitations:

- Limited data retrieval â€“ Values are placeholders, as full data retrieval functions arenâ€™t implemented
- Basic error handling â€“ Some edge cases may not be handled gracefully
- No Appending - Appends have not been implemented.

## Future Improvements

- Implement value retrieval functions to display actual data
- Appender Functionality
- Add the advanced example functionality
- Improve error handling
- Add support for additional platforms
- Implement more DuckDB features (transactions, user-defined functions, etc.)
